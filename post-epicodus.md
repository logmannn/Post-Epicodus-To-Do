# Post-Epicodus Plan

Goal:
Spend the first part of today putting together your plan. You should devote at least an hour to this exercise. Save your plan in a Markdown file and make regular commits to Github (at least once per hour). The items on your plan should be as specific as possible. Your plan should include at least twenty items. (Even if you can't complete all of these items in the next few months, they can still become long-term goals or ultimately shift into other goals.) It's also fine if your plan includes more than twenty items. If necessary, include links or screenshots that articulate your plans.

The objective of this exercise is set goals and have a solid plan to keep you motivated beyond the daily structure of Epicodus.
